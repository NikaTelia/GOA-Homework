 Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cocoa beans that can be a liquid, solid, or paste, 
 <br>either by itself or to flavor other foods. Cocoa beans are the processed seeds 
 <br>of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). 
 <br>They are usually fermented to develop 
 <br>the flavor, then dried, cleaned, and roasted. 
 <br>The shell is removed to reveal nibs, which are ground to chocolate liquor: 
 <br>unadulterated chocolate in rough form. The liquor can be processed to separate its two components, 
 <br>cocoa solids and cocoa butter, or shaped and sold as unsweetened baking chocolate. By adding sugar, 
 <br>sweetened chocolates are produced, which can be sold simply as dark chocolate, or, 
 <br>with the addition of milk, can be made into milk chocolate. Making milk chocolate with cocoa butter and without cocoa solids produces white chocolate.
